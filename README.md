# youtube-live-parser
PHP-based web application to view live video and chats from Youtube outside of their platform.

Uses the Python Selenium-based scraper I built at [https://github.com/TechMaz/youtube-live-chat-scraper](https://github.com/TechMaz/youtube-live-chat-scraper) to scrape chats from a live Youtube Video periodically and display them next to the embedded live video.

Try it out by going to `https://youtube-live-chat.herokuapp.com/video/<id>` where `<id>` is replaced with the live videoID from youtube.com. E.g.: [https://youtube-live-chat.herokuapp.com/video/MFH0i0KcE_o](https://youtube-live-chat.herokuapp.com/video/MFH0i0KcE_o)
